# Lectures

Contains the lecture slides, in latex and pdf.

You can **open the latex files** with your favorite latex editor or load the folder into overleaf.

--

The **Makefile is not needed**, it only exists to make it easier to maintain the open source repository. E.g. 'make' builds all PDFs, 'make clean' removes all pdflatex temporary files, 'make distclean' checks if any images can be deleted and 'make cpmpy' will check that all CPMpy files run without errors.
