    "\n",
    "Constraint Programming is a **declarative paradigm** for solving **combinatorial problems**. In CP, a problem is modelled by defining:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Variables**: They represent the solution, as entities that their values need to be determined.\n",
    "- **Domains**: The set of possible values for the decision variables.\n",
    "- **Constraints**: Relationships between variables restricting their possible values.\n",
    "- **Objective (Optional)**: If the problem includes an optimisation objective, we can define an objective to minimize or maximize.\n",
    "\n",
    "CP allows you to focus on **what** needs to be satisfied, without specifying **how** to solve the problem."
