    "Once we've made a decision on a particular solving backend that we want to target, we can start looking at configuring said backend. Each solver (OR-Tools, Choco, Exact, ...) has is own unique interface. And thus each solver exposes their own unique set of options that we can start tweaking in order to get more performance out of it. By default, solvers will often use some heuristic as to guess what a good set of options could be. In order to stay performant, not much time on this optimization will be spend. We on the other hand can do our own experiments and figure out which set of settings work best for the particular problem that we're trying to solve.\n",

It will start with some random samples to try and identify some patterns/correlations (exploration), but will not be able to build its probabilitic model in time to start benefitting from it (exploitation). So it should be quite similar to the random search approach. By increasing the number of iterations, we should start seeing it search more systrematically; staying close to known good regions in the search space and preventing regions with very bad regions."
