# Exercises

The exercises are in the Python-based CPMpy library. The exercises are in a Python Notebook, so the students can practice on their own laptop (or in Google Colab).

We provide notebooks with and without solutions. If you are a student, think about the learning opportunity you are denying yourself by looking at the solutions...

There are 6 exercise sessions (and an initial one for at home)

## E0: Homework: testing the exercise setup

* E0_homework_setup.ipynb

    To test that you have a working jupyter notebook with CPMpy setup.

## E1: Basic modeling

* E1_basic_modeling.ipynb

    Short intro to CPMpy and basic modeling exercises.

## E2: Debugging, solving, explaining and reification

* E2_debug_expl_reif.ipynb

    Exercises on solving, debugging, explaining and reification.

## E3: Global constraints

* E3_global_constraints.ipynb
    
    Exercises on modeling with global constraints.

## E4: Advanced modeling 1: viewpoints

* E4_viewpoints.ipynb
    
    Exercises on viewpoints, channeling, auxiliary variables and implied constraints.

## E5: Advanced modeling 2: symmetry

* E5_symmetry.ipynb

    Exercises on symmetry and dominance breaking.

## E6: Solving technologies + algorithm configuration

Consists of two parts:

* E6a_solving.ipynb

    Exercises on solving technologies and encodings

* E6b_configuration.ipynb

    Hands-on exercises on Algorithm Selection, Algorithm Configuration and Hyperparameter Configuration
